## Overview

The desired outcome of the `lossrx` R package is to provide actuaries
and data scientists valuable tools and frameworks for performing
Property Casualty related workflows.

Specifically, the package will contain:

-   A suite of utility and workflow oriented functions bundled as an R
    package
-   A plumber API that serves various endpoints related to a backend
    database and models
-   A comprehensive, yet simple migration-friendly relational database
    representing the various entities, attributes, and relationships
    involved with actuarial reserving.[^1]
-   A demo Shiny App for Actuarial Loss Development and Reserving
    including triangles, loss development factor selection, preliminary
    ultimates, etc. and a backend database/API to store results and
    selections.
-   Comprehensive documentation and tests

## Installation

You can install the development version of `lossrx` with `pak`: [^2]

``` r
pak::pak("jimbrig/lossrx")
```

## Data

### Data Preparation

This package utilizes a lot of data and in turn has a lot of code inside
the [data-raw](data-raw) folder. I recommend taking a look at its
[README](data-raw/README.md) to gain an understanding of how the data
was prepared for both use in the package as well as included and
uploaded to the database.

Data is prepared in the following ways:

-   Simulated transactional claims data using the
    [claims_transactional.R Simulation R
    Script](https://github.com/jimbrig/lossrx/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/claims_transactional.R)
-   Downloaded and extracted using ropensci’s [piggyback
    package](https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback) - see the
    [dataprep.R
    Script](https://github.com/jimbrig/lossrx/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/dataprep.R).
-   Supplemental *mocked data* generated using the [Mockaroo
    API](https://www.mockaroo.com/) for randomizing certain data
    attribute’s.
-   Uploaded and merged into the relational database using `SQL`, `R`,
    `CSVs`, and `YAML` files (see below about database details).
-   Certain datasets are budled and included with the package as native
    `.rda` packaged data files.

### Database

*View Detailed [Database
Documentation](https://dbdocs.io/jimbrigf0cdc6204e/Actuarial-Database)
created via `dbdocs`*

The core database files are housed in the [inst/database](inst/database)
directory and are included on package installation.
