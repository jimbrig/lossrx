<li>This vignette is specific to Loss Reserving (also known as claims
reserving) for <strong>Property and Casualty</strong> (P&amp;C, or

<h2 id="Intro">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#Intro"></a>
</h2>
<p>An important feature that distinguishes insurance from other sectors
of the economy is the timing of the exchange of considerations. In
manufacturing, payments for goods are typically made at the time of a
transaction. In contrast, for insurance, money received from a customer
occurs in advance of benefits or services; these are rendered at a later
date if the insured event occurs. This leads to the need to hold a
<em>reservoir of wealth to meet future obligations in respect to
obligations made, and to gain the trust of the insureds that the company
will be able to fulfill its commitments</em>. The size of this reservoir
of wealth, and the importance of ensuring its adequacy, is a major
concern for the insurance industry. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-community">Community, n.d.</a>)</span></p>
<p>The money that gets set aside to pay off future unpaid claims is what
actuaries refer to as the <em>Loss Reserve</em>. When companies
summarize their financial position and well-being they must utilize
these estimated values to determine their total liabilities on their
companies balance sheet. Loss reserves occur on timely intervals known
as <em>valuation or evaluation dates</em> which simply mean <em>as of
this date in time</em>.</p>
<p>Claims that arise (are opened/reported to the insurance provider)
before valuation dates can fall under one of the following
scenarios:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Claim has been paid in full</li>
<li>Claim is in the process of being paid</li>
<li>Claim is about to be paid</li>
</ol>
<p>However, claims that occur <em>after</em> the evaluation date
(i.e. in the future) are unknown but still need to be accounted for.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="RoleofActuary">The Role of The Actuary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#RoleofActuary"></a>
</h3>
<p>Actuaries are concerned with forecasting future payments due to
claims. Accurately estimating these payments is important from the
perspectives of various stakeholders in the insurance industry. For the
management of the insurer, the estimates of unpaid claims inform
decisions in underwriting, pricing, and strategy. For the investors,
loss reserves, and transactions related to them, are essential
components in the balance sheet and income statement of the insurer. In
addition, for the regulators, accurate loss reserves are needed to
appropriately understand the financial soundness of the insurer. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kuo_deeptriangle_2019">Kuo

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="TheNeedForLossReserving">The Need for Loss Reserving<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#TheNeedForLossReserving"></a>
</h3>
<p>The inverted production cycle of the insurance market and the claim
dynamics motivate the need for reserving and the design of predictive
modeling tools to estimate reserves. In insurance, the premium income
precedes the costs. An insurer will charge a client a premium, before
actually knowing how costly the insurance policy or contract will
become. In typical manufacturing industry this is not the case and the
manufacturer knows - before selling a product - what the cost of
producing this product was. At a specified evaluation moment τ the
insurer will predict outstanding liabilities with respect to contracts
sold in the past. This is the claims reserve or loss reserve; it is the
capital necessary to settle open claims from past exposures. It is a
very important element on the balance sheet of the insurer, more
specifically on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Accuracy in Loss Reserving is vital to insurers for many reasons,
including but not limited to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Loss reserves represent an anticipated claim that the insurer owes
its customers. Under-reserving may result in a failure to meet claim
liabilities. Conversely, an insurer with excessive reserves may present
a conservative estimate of surplus and thus portray a weaker financial
position than it truly has.</li>
<li>Reserves provide an estimate for the unpaid cost of insurance that
can be used for pricing contracts.</li>
<li>Loss reserving is required by laws and regulations. The public has a
strong interest in the financial strength and solvency of insurers.</li>
<li>In addition to regulators, other stakeholders such as insurance
company management, investors, and customers make decisions that depend
on company loss reserves. Whereas regulators and customers appreciate
conservative estimates of unpaid claims, managers and investors seek
more unbiased estimates to represent the true financial health of the
company.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="LifevsNonLife">Life vs Property Casualty<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#LifevsNonLife"></a>
</h3>
<p>Loss reserving is a topic where there are substantive differences
between life and general, also known as property and casualty (P&amp;C),
or non-life insurance.</p>
<p>In life insurance, the severity (amount of loss) is often not a
source of uncertainty as payouts are specified in the contract. The
frequency, driven by mortality of the insured, is a concern. However,
because of the lengthy time for settlement of life insurance contracts,
the time value of money uncertainty as measured from issue to date of
payment can dominate frequency concerns.</p>
<p>In contrast, for most lines of non-life business, severity is a major
source of uncertainty and contract’s duration tend to be shorter.</p>

company, payments will follow to reimburse the financial loss of the

<p><em>Claim Status</em> is an important field in the claims dataset. It
represents what section of the Life Cycle represented above a claim is
currently undergoing. There are three possible situations for a claim’s
status:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Closed</li>
<li>Reported but Note Full Settled (RBNS)</li>
<li>Incurred but not Reported (IBNR)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: for convenience and simplicity, we are assuming that a
closed claim cannot re-open</em>.</p>
<div class="section level4">

<p>For claims that are closed, the complete development has already been
observed. With the red line in the figure below indicating the present
moment, all events from the claim’s development take place before the
present moment. Hence, these events are observed at the present
moment.</p>

<p>We now shed light on the data available to estimate the outstanding
reserve for a portfolio of P&amp;C contracts. Insurance companies
typically register data on the development of an individual claim on a
micro, claim-specific level. We refer to data registered at this level
as granular or micro-level data.</p>
<p>Typically, an actuary aggregates the information registered on the
individual development of claims across all claims in a portfolio. This
aggregation leads to data structured in a <em>triangular
format</em>.</p>
<p>Such data are called <em>aggregate</em> or <em>macro-level</em> data
because each cell in the triangle displays information obtained by
aggregating the development of multiple claims.</p>
<p>The triangular display used in loss reserving is called a run-off or
development triangle. On the vertical axis the triangle lists the
accident or occurrence years during which a portfolio is followed. The
loss payments booked for a specific claim are connected to the year
during the which the insured event occurred. The horizontal axis
indicates the payment delay since occurrence of the insured event.</p>

<p>First, Section @ref(S:motivation) motivates the need for loss
reserving, then Section @ref(S:Data) studies the available data sources
and introduces some formal notation to tackle loss reserving as a
prediction challenge. Next, Section @ref(S:Chain-ladder) covers the
chain-ladder method and Mack’s distribution-free chain-ladder model.
Section @ref(S:GLMs) then develops a fully stochastic approach to
determine the outstanding reserve with generalized linear models (GLMs),
including the technique of bootstrapping to obtain a predictive
distribution of the outstanding reserve via simulation.</p>
